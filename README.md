Clone this respository (either by downloading it as a zip or through git clone), and run `npm install` to install the dependencies. This project is intended to have as few direct dependencies as possible, and only uses jsonwebtoken and mongoose.



## Running information

The command to run the server (after you setup your secrets.json file) is `npm start`.
